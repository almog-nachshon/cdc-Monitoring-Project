## ⚡ ONE-PAGE CHEAT SHEET

**How to Start System**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**How to Verify Data Flow**
```bash
# Insert test data
docker compose exec -T mysql-client mysql -h tidb -P 4000 -uroot appdb -e \
  "INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES ('test', 'pass', 'test@example.com');"

# Check Elasticsearch
curl http://localhost:9200/cdc-events/_count

# Check Prometheus  
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep cdc_events_total

# Check Grafana
http://localhost:3001 (user: admin, pass: admin)
```

**Key Architecture Points**
1. CDC captures database changes in real-time
2. Kafka provides reliable, decoupled queuing
3. Consumer bridges Kafka to storage and metrics
4. Elasticsearch stores full event documents
5. Prometheus stores operational metrics
6. Grafana visualizes insights in real-time

**Three Layers**
- **Capture Layer:** TiDB + TiCDC
- **Transport Layer:** Kafka + Zookeeper
- **Processing Layer:** Consumer + Storage (ES/Prometheus)
- **Visualization Layer:** Grafana + Kibana
